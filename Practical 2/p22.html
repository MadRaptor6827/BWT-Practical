<h1 align="center">About the computer</h1>
<br>
<p align="center">A computer is a programmable electronic device that takes
                data as input, processes it using a CPU according to software
                instructions, and produces output and stores information.
                It consists of physical components called hardware 
                (like keyboards, monitors, and the central processing unit) 
                and non-physical components like programs and data known as 
                software.Computers perform various tasks by executing programs,
                ranging from mathematical calculations to manipulating complex data
                like photos, videos, and text documents.</p>

<h1 align="left">About Hardware</h1>
<p align="left">Hardware refers to the physical, tangible components of an 
                electronic device, like a computer, that can be seen and 
                touched.These parts include the central processing unit (CPU),
                memory, hard drives, monitors, keyboards, and other peripheral
                devices, all of which work together to enable the system's
                function. Hardware is distinct from software, which consist
                of the intangible instructions and programs that tell the 
                hardware what to do.</p>
                <br>
<h1 align="right">About Software</h1>
<p align="right">Software is a collection of computer programs, data, 
                and instructions that tell a computer or device how to
                perform specific tasks, making it the intangible, 
                non-physical component of any digital system. It enables
                users to interact with devices, such as creating graphics, 
                editing videos, and managing information, without needing 
                to understand the underlying hardware. Software is categorized
                into three main types: System Software, which manages the
                computer's resources (e.g., operating systems); Application 
                Software, which performs specific user tasks 
                (e.g., word processors); and Programming Software,
                which helps developers create other software.</p>
